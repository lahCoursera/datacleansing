## Project

This assigment is for the Week 4 of the Data Cleansing course. The object of this assigment is to download data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip, and create a single tidy data file.

Tidy data is define as data files having:

        * Observations in rows
        * Variables in columns
        * Discriptive variables
        * One observation per row
        
## Deliverables

We are to upload four files into the github repository.  These for files are:

        * readme.md file - explains the files involved with the project
        * CodeBook.md - define variables, functions, and procudures used for this project
        * run_analysis.R - the code used to process the raw data into the final text file
        * mytidydata.txt - Resulting tidy data file

Please revere to the CodeBook.md file to review the process that was used to create the tidy data set.
